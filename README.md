# neovim-setup

Dirty, hacked-up Neovim setup using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as the plugin manager.
Needs [a Nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest) to display correctly.
Currently only uses the rust-analyzer language server.

# TODO

- Cleanup
- Add more support
- Proper installation instructions
